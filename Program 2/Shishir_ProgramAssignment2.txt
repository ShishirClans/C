    This program reads city data from a file and calculates various data, such as population density, pollution, traffic, crime, expense,
    number of highways.Using these data, it computes a livability value for each city and displays the results. The code keeps track of 
    the most livable city and provides a summary of all cities, including the average livability and the name of the best city.
    In the main.c file we have declared necessary variables, used a file pointer to open and read a file, an output format
    for the heading, once the the file is closed once its read and summary function is called which gives us a report for the number of cities, its livability value and the name of the most livable city.
